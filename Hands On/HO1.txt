Text Classification using TF-IDF

Given Data:
You have three short documents (D1, D2, and D3) and their corresponding content (dont need to remove stop words):

    D1: "The sky is blue."
    D2: "The ocean is deep."
    D3: "Blue whales live in the ocean."

======================
Term Frequency (TF) Calculation:
Compute the term frequency (TF) for the term "blue" in each document. Remember, the formula for TF is:

​TF(t,d) = # of times term t appears in document d / total # of terms in document d
----------------------
D1
TF("the", D1) = 2/4 = 0.5
TF("sky", D1) = 1/4 = 0.25
TF("is", D1) = 1/4 = 0.25
TF("blue", D1) = 1/4 = 0.25
----------------------
D2
TF("the", D2) = 1/4 = 0.25
TF("ocean", D2) = 1/4 = 0.25
TF("is", D2) = 1/4 = 0.25
TF("deep", D2) = 1/4 = 0.25
----------------------
D3
TF("blue", D3) = 1/5 = 0.2
TF("whales", D3) = 1/5 = 0.2
TF("live", D3) = 1/5 = 0.2
TF("in", D3) = 1/5 = 0.2
TF("the", D3) = 1/5 = 0.2
TF("ocean", D3) = 1/5 = 0.2
======================
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) Calculation:
Compute the inverse document frequency (IDF) for the term "blue". Use the formula:

IDF(t,D) = log(Total # of documents / Number of documents with term t in it)
----------------------
Total # of documents = 3
Number of documents with term "blue" = 2
IDF("blue") = log(3/2) = 0.176
======================
TF-IDF Calculation:
Compute the TF-IDF score for the term "blue" in each document using the formula:

TFIDF(t,d,D)= TF(t,d) × IDF(t,D)
----------------------
IDF("blue") = 0.176
----------------------
D1
TF("blue", D1) = 0.25
TFIDF("blue", D1) = 0.25 * 0.176 = 0.044
----------------------
D2
TF("blue", D2) = 0
TFIDF("blue", D2) = 0 * 0.176 = 0
----------------------
D3
TF("blue", D3) = 1/5 = 0.2
TFIDF("blue", D3) = 0.2 * 0.176 = 0.035
======================
Document Classification:
You are given that higher TF-IDF scores for the term "blue" are more relevant to the category "Nature". Based on the TF-IDF scores you've computed, rank the documents in order of their relevance to the "Nature" category.

Based on the TF-IDF scores, the documents should be ranked as follows:
D1 > D3 > D2
